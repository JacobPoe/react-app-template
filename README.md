# My Full-Stack TypeScript Project

A full-stack web application built with **React** and **TypeScript** on the client-side and a **Node.js** server (also written in TypeScript) on the backend. The client assets are bundled using **Webpack**. This repository contains a unified setup with a single `package.json` to manage dependencies and scripts.

## Overview

This project serves as a quickstart template for a React single page application.
It runs both the client and server on a single port. Client code is bundled using Webpack,
and is hosted on an Express server. 

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** – A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Node.js** – A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express** – A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Webpack** – A module bundler for client-side assets.
